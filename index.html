        <div>About me</div>
        <div class="bio-container">I am a student at Mayden Academy in Bath completing  a 16 week intensive, full-stack software developer programme.

            Iâ€™m quickly growing my technical skills and have adopted an agile approach to individual and team tasks.

            Before this I was a Director at a startup company based in London, we grew the company from a team of 2 to 25 in 5 years.

            I have extensive experience in sales & marketing, key account management and operations.

            I got a taste for writing code when I commissioned the build of a SQL database and worked closely with the developer, so I found and applied to Mayden Academy.

            I live in a small village in Cornwall by the sea with my family, we enjoy the outdoor lifestyle, the beach, BBQ and pubs.

            HTML - CSS

            I am familiar with Git and own a certified scrum master certificate.

            Next Steps

            The next step is to find an opportunity as a junior developer in a company with a fantastic culture that can support my development and help launch my new career.
